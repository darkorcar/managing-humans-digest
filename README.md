- You want to work with your team, you want to learn from them, I want them to trust me.
- Pure delegators are slowly becoming irrelevant to their organisations.

## The Update, the Vent, and the Disaster (one-on-ones)

Assume they have something to teach you.

Basics:

- hold regular one-on-one
- always do it
- give at least 30 minutes

### Three types of ono-on-ones

1. The Update

    These typically start as status updates, but that is wrong. A one-on-one is not a status report. Start listening twice as hard for a nugget of something that we can discuss, investigate, and explore.

2. The Vent

    When the Vent begins, you might confuse this for a conversation. It's not. It's a mental release valve, and your job is to listen for as long as it takes. **Don't problem solve. Don't redirect. Don't comfort.** Yet. Your employee is doing mental house cleaning, and interrupting this cleaning is missing the point.

3. The Disaster

    If a Vent feels like a speech, a Disaster feels like an attack. Your primary job during the Disaster is to defuse, and you start defusing by contributing absolutely nothing. Be quiet and let the emotion pass. Success comes with traversing the emotional explosion. 

    **A Disaster is the end result of poor management.**
